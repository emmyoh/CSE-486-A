Lecture notes from the 2023 undergraduate course `Introduction to Artificial Intelligence', given by Professor Khodakhast Bibak at Miami University at Benton Hall in the academic year 2023-2024. This course covers introductory artificial intelligence concepts. Credit for the material in these notes is due to Professor Khodakhast Bibak, while the structure is loosely taken from the in-class lectures. The credit for the typesetting is my own.

\textit{Disclaimer:} This document will inevitably contain some mistakes---both simple typos and legitimate errors. Keep in mind that these are the notes of an undergraduate student in the process of learning the material, so take what you read with a grain of salt. If you find mistakes and feel like telling me, I will be grateful and happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of errors.
