\subsection{Naive Bayes Algorithm}\label{sub_sec:naive_bayes_algorithm}

In the context of email spam filtering, we have a training data set and a testing data set. From the training data, we can calculate $P(\text{Spam}) = \frac{|\text{Spam}|}{|\text{Spam}| + |\text{Ham}|}$, $P(\text{Ham}) = \frac{|\text{Ham}|}{|\text{Spam}| + |\text{Ham}|}$. For each $w \in \text{Spam} \cup \text{Ham}$, where $w$ is a word, we may find $P(w \mid \text{Spam}) = \frac{P(|w \in \text{Spam}|) + 1}{|\text{Spam}| + 2}$---the $+1$ \& $+2$ ensure a probability of $50\%$ when $|w \in \text{Spam}| = 0$ (ie, when the word, $w$, appears only in the `ham' set in the training data)---and $P(w \mid \text{Ham}) = \frac{P(|w \in \text{Ham}|) + 1}{|\text{Ham}| + 2}$. Within the testing data, we have several emails, and we are aiming to determine if they're spam or not. For each $\text{Email} \in \text{Testing Set}$, we have in the email a set of distinct words, $X$, where every word in $X$ also appears in the training data (and, therefore, has a probability associated with it). Where $X := \text{Email} \cap (\text{Spam} \cup \text{Ham}): P(\text{Spam} \mid X) \approx \frac{P(\text{Spam}) \underset{x \in X}{\prod} P(x \mid \text{Spam})}{P(\text{Spam}) \underset{x \in X}{\prod} P(x \mid \text{Spam}) + P(\text{Ham}) \underset{x \in X}{\prod} P(x \mid \text{Ham})}$; if $P(\text{Spam} \mid X) > 0.5$ then we classify $\text{Email}$ as `spam', otherwise we classify $\text{Email}$ as `ham'. If $P(w \mid \text{Spam}) = 0$, then $P(\text{Spam} \mid X) = 0$, and if $P(w \mid \text{Ham}) = 0$, then $P(\text{Ham} \mid X) = 1$, requiring us to have added the $+1$s \& $+2$s earlier to prevent either of these probabilities from being $0$.
